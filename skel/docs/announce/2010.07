        Announce: Rakudo Star Distribution Release 1

On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I'm pleased to announce the first
"Rakudo Star" release. It is a distribution release containing the Rakudo 
Perl 6 compiler, modules and documentation, aiming to be a useable development
environment.

This is not a Perl 6 production release, or a finalized 6.0 release.
