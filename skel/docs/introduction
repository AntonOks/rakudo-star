How to start using Perl 6
=========================

If you alredy know Perl 5, the "Perl 5 to 6" series of articles [1]
aimed at people familiar with Perl 5, will show you the most
significant changes, step by step.

If You're completely new to Perl, Gabor Szabo's screencasts [2] will
introduce you to Perl 6 from the very beginning, showing the effects
of every example in real time.

In both cases You'll probably be interested in Perl 6 Advent
Calendar [3], showing "something cool about Perl 6 every day".
Advent Calendar shows some nice new features of Perl 6, explains
the new operators and shows many interesting, challenging examples
of their usage.

For a more official source of information, the formal specification
of Perl 6 [4] is also available for reading.
