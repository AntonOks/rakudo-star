Rakudo Star -- a Perl 6 distribution based on Rakudo Perl

See <http://wiki.github.com/rakudo/rakudo/whats-going-into-rakudo> for a list
of modules we want included in the distribution.

This repository doesn't contain a distribution, it contains the tools
and scripts to build a distribution.  Run "make" to populate a distribution
image in the dist/ directory.  Currently this assumes that you have
the following tools available:

    * git
    * wget
