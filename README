Rakudo Star -- a Perl 6 distribution based on Rakudo Perl

See <http://wiki.github.com/rakudo/rakudo/whats-going-into-rakudo> for a list
of modules we want included in the distribution.

This repository doesn't contain a distribution, it contains the tools
and scripts to build a distribution.  Run "make VERSION=yyyy.mm" to populate 
a distribution image in the rakudo-star-yyyy.mm/ directory.

*** This task should only be done by a release manager, or for testing 
your changes if you want to contribute to Rakudo Star. If you just want
to use Rakudo Star, please download a pre-built tar.gz from
http://github.com/rakudo/star/downloads ***

The build system assumes that you have the following tools available:

    * perl
    * make
    * git
    * wget
    * cp
    * find
    * tar
    * touch

The skel/ directory contains the basic layout of documentation and
other support files, other components are then populated into to
the target directory via the make command above.

To create a candidate release tarball, try "make release VERSION=yyyy.mm".
