1. Drag the 'Rakudo' folder onto the '/Applications' folder. Note this 
is the root Applications directory and other locations won't work.

2. Drag the 'Docs' folder somewhere.

3. In a Terminal window add Rakudo Star to your path:

   export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Rakudo/bin:/Applications/Rakudo/share/perl6/site/bin

   Test with:

   perl6 -e 'say "Hello, world!";'

4. Add the 'export' line above to .bash_profile or similar to persist.

5. Useful commands are 'p6doc' and 'panda'.

6. See also the documents in the 'Docs' folder and http://perl6.org
